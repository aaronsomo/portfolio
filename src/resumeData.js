  aboutme:
    "Welcome! I'm Aaron and I have a knack for building creative and meaningful things, be it a bridge in Chicago or a web application on the Internet. As a former Civil Engineer, I’ve worked with different teams to utilize my creative nature in designing and managing many projects, but they haven’t quite filled that void - that curiosity in seeing an idea, solving issues, and having that idea realized. Software Engineering has me expressing that passion, as I take on more challenges, and I couldn't be happier.",
