    `Hey there! My name's Aaron Southammavong. I'm nothing more than your average eager learner with a penchant for creating... just... things. From building lego bridges as a toddler to designing and managing the construction of real bridges in the city of Chicago; from thinking of app ideas to launching three successful apps in both the iOS App Store and Google Play Store; from eating, traveling, dancing, and laughing to making video montages of those moments - I explore multiple facets of life to create "somethings" out of "not-so-nothings." I also bake a lot and can give you a run for your money in ping pong. I truly live to enjoy life and help others do the same.`,
